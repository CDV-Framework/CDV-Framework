# Case Study Template - Usage Guide

## Quick Start

**Time to complete:** 20-40 hours depending on data availability

**Minimum requirements:**
- Platform documentation
- Basic participation statistics
- 2-3 evaluators for scoring
- Access to users/officials (interviews recommended but not required)

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Preparation (4-6 hours)

**1.1 Form Evaluation Team**
- Minimum: 3 people
- Ideal composition:
  - 1 government official/platform admin
  - 1 citizen user
  - 1 independent researcher
- Why diversity matters: Different perspectives prevent bias

**1.2 Gather Basic Information**
- Platform name, location, launch date
- Governing documents (laws, decrees, policies)
- User statistics (registered, active, proposals, etc.)
- Any existing evaluations or studies

**1.3 Set Scope**
- Time period to evaluate (e.g., 2020-2024)
- Which processes to include (all vs sample)
- Language(s) of case study

---

### Phase 2: Data Collection (10-15 hours)

**2.1 Platform Data (2-3 hours)**
Access platform itself:
- Create account, explore features
- Download statistics if available
- Screenshot key features/pages
- Test accessibility (WCAG check)

**2.2 Official Documentation (3-4 hours)**
Collect:
- Launch announcements
- User guides
- Annual reports
- Policy documents
- Budget information

**2.3 Academic/Media Sources (3-4 hours)**
Search:
- Google Scholar: "[platform name] participation"
- News archives: Coverage of platform
- Social media: User discussions
- Academic databases (if available)

**2.4 Primary Data (Optional, 4-6 hours)**
If resources allow:
- 5-10 user interviews (30 min each)
- 3-5 official interviews
- Platform observation session
- User survey (can use template)

---

### Phase 3: CDV Evaluation (8-12 hours)

**For each dimension (1-1.5 hours per dimension):**

**Step 1: Individual Scoring (20 min)**
- Each evaluator reads scale descriptions
- Scores 1-5 independently
- Writes brief rationale

**Step 2: Group Discussion (30 min)**
- Share scores
- Discuss discrepancies
- Present evidence

**Step 3: Consensus (10-15 min)**
- Agree on final score (or document split)
- Write final rationale
- List supporting evidence

**Pro tip:** Start with easiest dimensions (often Integrity/Sustainability) to build momentum.

---

### Phase 4: Analysis & Writing (6-10 hours)

**4.1 Draft Core Sections (4-6 hours)**
Priority order:
1. CDV Evaluation (most important)
2. Evidence & Data
3. Context & Background
4. Platform Description
5. Lessons Learned

**4.2 Comparative Analysis (1-2 hours)**
Compare with:
- Similar platforms (same country/region)
- Best practices (Barcelona, Reykjavik)
- Your own benchmarks

**4.3 Recommendations (1-2 hours)**
Based on:
- Low-scoring dimensions (what to improve)
- High-scoring dimensions (what to maintain)
- Comparative insights (what others do better)

---

### Phase 5: Review & Finalize (2-4 hours)

**5.1 Internal Review**
- All evaluators read full draft
- Check consistency
- Verify sources
- Confirm data accuracy

**5.2 External Review (Optional)**
- Share with platform administrators (right of response)
- Share with academic peers
- Incorporate feedback

**5.3 Final Checks**
- All references complete?
- All tables/charts labeled?
- Consistent formatting?
- Executive summary accurate?

---

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: "We don't have demographic data"

**Solution:**
- Note absence in Inclusion dimension (lowers score)
- Use proxy indicators (geographic distribution if available)
- Qualitative observations from interviews
- Compare with census data (who's missing?)

**In text:**
> "Note: Platform does not collect demographic data. Inclusion score based on qualitative observations and comparison with municipal census data showing likely underrepresentation of [groups]."

---

### Challenge 2: "Officials won't share data"

**Solution:**
- Request under freedom of information laws (if applicable)
- Use publicly available data only (lower depth but valid)
- Note data limitations in methodology
- Compare with leaked/reported figures

**Adjust scoring:**
If data unavailable for dimension:
- Score based on available evidence
- Add asterisk: "Score provisional pending data access"
- Lower confidence in final CDV score

---

### Challenge 3: "Evaluators disagree on scores"

**Solution:**
- Document split scores (e.g., "Score: 3-4, evaluators split 2-1")
- Explain disagreement in rationale
- Both perspectives valuable (shows complexity)
- Final score can be average or range

**Example:**
> "**Score: 3-4** (Evaluators split)  
> Majority (2/3) scored 4 based on [evidence]. One evaluator scored 3 citing [concern]. This reflects genuine ambiguity in [dimension]."

---

### Challenge 4: "Platform too new for long-term evaluation"

**Solution:**
- Focus on design and short-term dimensions (1, 2, 3, 4, 6)
- Score sustainability based on *plans* not outcomes
- Note limitation in Co-Evaluation section
- Plan follow-up evaluation in 2-3 years

**Scoring:**
- Dimension 5 (Co-Evaluation): May only have short-term data
- Dimension 7d (Sustainability): Score based on:
  - Legal framework (exists or not)
  - Budget commitments (multi-year or annual)
  - Political statements (reliable or not)

---

### Challenge 5: "My platform is different from examples"

**Solution:**
- Template is adaptable!
- Modify sections as needed
- Add context-specific content
- Remove non-applicable parts

**Common adaptations:**
- **National vs Municipal:** Add section on federal structure
- **Developed vs Developing:** Expand digital divide analysis
- **Sector-specific:** (health, education) Add domain context
- **Pilot vs Established:** Emphasize learning vs outcomes
